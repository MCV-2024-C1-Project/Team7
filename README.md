### Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/MCV-2024-C1-Project/Team7
```

### Move to the corresponding directory
```
cd Team7
```

### Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Organize datasets
Even though different locations can be specified, in general the scripts assume a specific structure. To make sure everything works as expected, please create a file named ``data`` at the top level of the repository. Then, place the datasets ``BBDD``, ``qsd1_w2``, ``qsd2_w2``, ``qst1_w2`` and ``qst2_w2`` inside the folder ``data``.

### Run the main code
